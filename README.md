# Garbage Classification Dataset with ResNet-50

This repository provides an implementation of garbage classification using the ResNet-50 architecture in PyTorch. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which consists of various images of garbage items classified into different categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains a diverse collection of images representing different types of garbage. It includes classes such as plastic bottles, paper, cardboard, glass, metal cans, and more. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

You can find the dataset used in this project at [link to the Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification).

## Model Architecture

The ResNet-50 architecture is employed in this project for garbage classification. ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network that has demonstrated excellent performance on various computer vision tasks. It consists of 50 layers and utilizes skip connections to address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for efficient training and improved accuracy.


## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in garbage classification. For more detailed performance metrics and analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
